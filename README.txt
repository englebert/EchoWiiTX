EchoWiiTX is specifically for this custom made controller which can:
1. Having telemetry function
2. Able to scan the RF channels before each flight prevent interferences
3. Able to customize own settings
4. Changing the PID direct from the remote to RX module and command the FC.
5. Highly integrated to MultiWii aka rebranding as EchoWII.

Once I had completed the whole thing, I will release the schematics for everyone to build your own multirotor.
